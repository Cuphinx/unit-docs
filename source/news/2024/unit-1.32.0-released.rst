Unit 1.32.0 Released
####################

Unit 1.31.0 introduced a Technology Preview of a WebAssembly language module
and an SDK for C and Rust, helping developers build and run web applications
compiled to Wasm. Although effective, we recognized that a custom low-level
ABI on the host side and a developer SDK for server-side WebAssembly marked
not the conclusion, but a significant milestone in our journey.

Unit 1.32.0 comes with a new language module for WebAssembly that supports
the WASI 0.2 HTTP world so that WebAssembly Components implementing this
Interface can be hosted on Unit.

Additionally, we are adding the following features:

- Enhanced the NJS experience by making all Unit variables accessible
  from JavaScript

- Added support for conditional access logging

- Added support for changing Unit's control socket permissions

- Added a new variable **request_id**

...and much more! Keep reading to learn more about what changed since 1.31.1.

**********************
Unit is now on GitHub!
**********************

This release is special! Special for us and the Community! As you may have
noticed we have moved more and more of our development and planning workloads
from our old systems to GitHub.

GitHub is no longer just a read-only mirror. It now serves as the primary
source for our source code and tests. We invite you to create issues,
contribute through pull requests, or join our discussions. There are
many ways to get involved with us.

We've also fully transitioned the development and maintenance of unit.nginx.org
to GitHub. We look forward to pull requests and issues that will improve our
documentation.

WebAssembly next-level: Support for Wasm components and the WASI 0.2 API
************************************************************************

Since the release of Unit 1.31.0 in August 2023 and the announcement of our
technology preview for WebAssembly, a lot has changed an happened in the
WebAssembly ecosystem.

So we evolved and with 1.32.0, we are happy to announce the support for the
WebAssembly Component Model using the WASI 0.2 APIs. This will open the
possibilities to run Wasm Components compatible with the WASI 0.2 APIs on Unit
without having a need to rebuild them. This is also the first Language Module
for Unit that was driven by the Community. Special thanks to Alex Crichton
for the contribution!

You can find out more about this in our Blog post: WebAssembly Next-Level:
Support for Wasm Components

*******************************************************************
Enhanced scripting support - Use Unit-variables in NGINX JavaScript
*******************************************************************

Using JavaScript in Unit's configuration unlocks vast possibilities.
A simple Unit configuration can determine the routing or rewriting of a request
by dynamically generating the values for pass and rewrite
within a JavaScript function. While writing those functions or policies,
not having full access to all Unit variables available for the current
request turned out to be a huge issue!

With Unit 1.32.0 we have unlocked full access to all Unit variables
from our JavaScript runtime.

**************************
Conditional access logging
**************************

Access logs are a great way to monitor the traffic sent to Unit.
However, you might find that certain requests, such as regular
health checks and automated UI tests, aren't ones you want
cluttering up your logs. While these checks are crucial for monitoring
the health of your services or web applications, they can significantly
increase the volume of data in your access logs, leading to unnecessary noise.

With conditional access logging, you can define rules to decide if a request
should be logged or not.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "access_log": {
            "if": "`${uri == '/health' ? false : true}`",
            "path": "/var/log/unit/access.log",
            "format": "`${host + ': ' + uri}`"
    }

In this example we don't want to log any health checks sent to Unit.
Anything will be logged to the given file in the defined format as usual.
As shown in our example, to get the maximum out of the newly added **if**
option, you can combine it with our JavaScript scripting feature, but this
is not a must.

The **if** option also supports simple string validation to check if a value
is present in a request or not.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "access_log": {
            "if": "$cookie_session",
            "path": "â€¦"
    }

In this example Unit will check the existence of a Cookie named session
and only log request including this cookie.
